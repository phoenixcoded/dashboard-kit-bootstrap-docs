# üìê Quick Start

### Installation <a href="#installation" id="installation"></a>

Navigate to your root folder **(i.e. DashboardKit)**

```
c:>cd DashboardKit
```

Install packages by npm or yarn according to your preferences. Here we are using the npm package manager.

```
> npm i
```

After package installation, you can start your app by using **`Gulp`** command. This will regenerate the dist folder. You can keep this command running while making changes in the `src` folder. It will auto-apply to the `dist` folder and your browser.

```
> gulp
```
